# Setiment Analysis App

This Flask app is my first dive into Setiment Analysis. A user can submit a review and have it be automatically labelled as a **good review** or a **bad review** based on its Setiment Intensity compound score. 

For this first version I am using VADER. 

## Current Issues

1. Neutral options don't go anywhere
2. I don't think I'm generating the page efficiently
